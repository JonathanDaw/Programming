Chapter 9 defined the struct studentType to implement the basic properties of a student. Define the class studentType with the same 
components as the struct studentType, and add member functions to manipulate the data members. (Note that the data members of the class 
studentType must be private.)

Write a program to illustrate how to use the class studentType.

Struct studentType:
struct studentType
{
 string firstName;
 string lastName;
 char courseGrade;
 int testScore;
 int programmingScore;
 double GPA;
};
An example of the program is shown below:

Name: Sara Spilner
Grade: A
Test score: 89
Programming score: 92
GPA: 3.57
